/**
 * Integration tests for TaleAPI.
 * <p>
 * This package contains integration tests that verify the interaction
 * between multiple components or subsystems. Unlike unit tests that
 * focus on a single class, integration tests validate that different
 * parts of the system work together correctly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Organization</h2>
 * <p>
 * Integration tests are organized by feature area in sub-packages:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code integration.player} - Player-related integration tests</li>
 * <li>{@code integration.event} - Event system integration tests</li>
 * <li>etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Naming Convention</h2>
 * <p>
 * Integration test classes should end with {@code IntegrationTest}
 * to clearly distinguish them from unit tests.
 * </p>
